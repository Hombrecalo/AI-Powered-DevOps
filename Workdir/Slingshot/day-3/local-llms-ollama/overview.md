# ai-assisted-devops Overview

The project is a 10-day course syllabus for an AI-Assisted DevOps training program. The syllabus covers various topics related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in the context of DevOps, including:

1. Introduction to AI for DevOps
2. Popular AI tools for DevOps Engineers
3. Hands-on exercises to create a GitHub repository that checks the health of a virtual machine based on parameters such as CPU, disk space, memory, etc.
4. Mini-challenge: creating a bash script that confirms the health of a virtual machine when executed with an "explain" command.
5. Introduction to Prompt Engineering
6. Techniques for using AI-generated regex, Bash scripts, Terraform, and CI/CD configurations in DevOps
7. Running LLMs Locally and making API calls (via OpenAI APIs)
8. Hands-on exercises to create a Dockerfile that auto-generates Kubernetes manifests using an Ollama model
9. Introduction to AI-powered Shell Scripting and CLI Automation
10. Hands-on exercises to generate shell scripts for creating VPCs in AWS with best practices
11. Introduction to AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for Operations) and AI-powered monitoring
12. Hands-on exercises to create anomaly detection models using Python

The course also includes a capstone project where students are expected to build an AI Agent, which is an AI agent that performs a specific task in DevOps use cases.

Overall, the syllabus focuses on introducing students to various AI tools and techniques for improving their DevOps skills, including automation, monitoring, and anomaly detection.
